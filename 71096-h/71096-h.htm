  <h2 class='c005'>The Nightingale<br> <br>BEING A STORY FOR CHILDREN AND A PARABLE FOR MEN AND WOMEN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_8 c006'>In China, you must know, the Emperor is a
Chinaman, and all whom he has about him are
Chinamen too. It happened a good many years
ago, but that’s just why it’s worth while to hear
the story before it’s forgotten! The Emperor’s Palace
was the most splendid in the World; it was made entirely
of porcelain, very costly, but so delicate and brittle
that one had to take care how one touched it. In the
Garden were to be seen the most wonderful flowers, and
to the costliest of them silver bells were tied, which
sounded, so that nobody should pass by without noticing
the flowers. Yes, every thing in the Emperor’s Garden
was admirably arranged. And it extended so far, that the
Gardener himself did not know where the end was. If a
man went on and on, he came into a glorious forest with
high trees and deep lakes. The wood extended straight
down to the sea, which was blue and deep; great vessels
could sail beneath the branches of the trees, and in the
trees lived a Nightingale, which sang so splendidly that
even the poor Fisherman, who had many other things
to do, stopped still and listened, when he had gone out
at night to throw out his nets, and heard the Nightingale.
“How beautiful that is!” he said; but he was
obliged to attend to his property and thus forgot the
bird. But when in the next night, the bird sang again
and the Fisherman heard it, he exclaimed again, “How
beautiful that is!”</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>From all the countries of the World, Travellers came
to the City of the Emperor and admired it, and the Palace
and the Garden, but when they heard the song of
the Nightingale, they said: “That is the best of all!”
And the Travellers told of it when they came home; and
the learned men wrote many books about the Town,
the Palace, and the Garden. But they did not forget the
Nightingale; that was placed highest of all; and those
who were Poets wrote most magnificent poems about
the Nightingale in the wood, by the deep lake. The
books went through all the World; and a few of them
once came to the Emperor. He sat in his golden chair,
and read, and read; every moment he nodded his head,
for it pleased him to peruse the masterly descriptions of
the City, the Palace, and the Garden. “But the Nightingale
is the best of all!” it stood written there. “What’s
that? exclaimed the Emperor.” “I do not know the
Nightingale at all! Is there such a bird in my Garden?
I’ve never heard of that: to learn such a thing for the
first time from books!” And hereupon he called his
Cavalier. This Cavalier was so grand that if any one
lower in rank than himself dared to speak to him, or to
ask him any question, he answered nothing but P! and
that meant nothing.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_003.jpg' alt='Image of Garden' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c002'>“There is said to be a wonderful bird here called a
Nightingale!” said the Emperor. “They say it’s the best
thing in all my great Empire. Why have I never heard
any thing about it?” “I have never heard him named,”
replied the Cavalier. “He has never been introduced
at Court.” “I command that he shall appear this evening,
and sing before me,” said the Emperor. “All the
world knows what I possess, and I do not know it
myself!” “I have never heard him mentioned,” said the
Cavalier. “I will seek for him. I will find him.” But
where was he to be found? The Cavalier ran up and
down all the staircases, through halls and passages, but
no one among all those whom he met had heard talk
of the Nightingale. And the Cavalier ran back to the
Emperor, and said that it must be a fable invented by
the writers of books. “Your Imperial Majesty cannot
believe how much is written that is fiction, and something
that they call the black art.” “But the book in
which I read this,” said the Emperor, “was sent to me
by the High and Mighty Emperor of Japan, and therefore
it cannot be a falsehood. I will hear the Nightingale!
It must be here this evening! It has my imperial
favour! and if it does not come, all the Court shall be
trampled upon after the Court has supped!” “Tsing-pe,”
said the Cavalier; and again he ran up and down all
the staircases, and through all the halls and corridors;
and half the Court ran with him, for the Courtiers did
not like being trampled upon.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then there was a great inquiry after the wonderful
Nightingale, which all the World knew, excepting the
people at Court. At last they met with a poor little Girl
in the kitchen, who said, “The Nightingale? I know
it well; yes, it can sing gloriously. Every evening I get
leave to carry my poor sick mother the scraps from the
table. She lives down by the strand, and when I get back
and am tired, and rest in the wood, then I hear the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Nightingale sing! And then the water comes into my
eyes, and it is just as if my mother kissed me.” “Little
Kitchen-Girl,” said the Cavalier, “I will get you a place
in the kitchen, with permission to see the Emperor
dine, if you will lead us to the Nightingale, for it is announced
for this evening.”</p>

<p class='c002'>So they all went out into the wood where the Nightingale
was accustomed to sing; half the Court went
forth. When they were in the midst of their journey a
cow began to low. “Oh!” cried the court pages, “now
we have it! That shows a wonderful power in so small
a creature! I have certainly heard it before.” “No; those
are cows lowing,” said the little Kitchen-Girl. “We are
a long way from the place yet.” Now the frogs began to
quack in the marsh. “Glorious!” said the Chinese
Court Preacher. “Now I hear it: it sounds just like little
church bells.” “No; those are frogs,” said the little
Kitchen-Maid. “But now I think we shall soon hear it.”
And then the Nightingale began to sing.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_006.jpg' alt='Image of forest' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c002'>“That is it!” exclaimed the little Girl. “Listen, listen!
and yonder it sits,” and she pointed to a little gray bird
up in the boughs. “Is it possible?” cried the Cavalier.
“I should never have thought it looked like that. How
simple it looks! It must certainly have lost its colour
at seeing such grand people around.” “Little Nightingale!”
called the little Kitchen-Girl, quite loudly,
“our gracious Emperor wishes you to sing before him.”
“With the greatest pleasure!” replied the Nightingale,
and began to sing most delightfully. “It sounds just like
glass bells!” said the Cavalier. “And look at the little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>throat, how <a id='its'></a>it’s working! It’s wonderful that we should
never have heard it before. That bird will be a great success
at Court.” “Shall I sing once more before the Emperor?” asked
the Nightingale, for it thought the Emperor
was present. “My excellent little Nightingale,”
said the Cavalier, “I have great pleasure in inviting you
to a Court festival this evening, when you shall charm
his Imperial Majesty with your beautiful singing.”
“My song sounds best in the green wood!” replied the
Nightingale; still it came willingly when it heard what
the Emperor wished.</p>

<p class='c002'>The Palace was festively adorned. The walls
and the flooring, which were of porcelain,
gleamed in the rays of thousands of golden
lamps. The most glorious flowers, which
could ring clearly, had been placed in the passages.
There was a running to and fro, and a through draught,
and all the bells rang so loudly that one could not hear
one’s self speak. In the midst of the great hall, where
the Emperor sat, a golden perch had been placed, on
which the Nightingale was to sit. The whole Court
was there, and the little Cook-Maid had got leave to
stand behind the door, as she had now received the title
of a real Court cook. All were in full dress, and all
looked at the little gray bird, to which the Emperor
nodded.</p>

<p class='c002'>And the Nightingale sang so gloriously that the tears
came into the Emperor’s eyes. The tears ran down over
his cheeks, and then the Nightingale sang still more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>sweetly; that went straight to the heart. The Emperor
was so much pleased that he said the Nightingale
should have his golden slipper to wear round its neck.
But the Nightingale declined this with thanks, saying
it had already received a sufficient reward. “I have seen
tears in the Emperor’s eyes; that is the real treasure to
me! An Emperor’s tears have a peculiar power. I am
rewarded enough.” And then it sang again with a sweet,
glorious voice.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s the most amiable coquetry I ever saw!” said
the Ladies who stood round about, and then they took
water in their mouths to gurgle when any one spoke
to them. They thought they should be nightingales too.
And the lackeys and chambermaids reported that they
were satisfied too; and that was saying a good deal,
for they are the most difficult to please. In short the
Nightingale achieved a real success. It was now to remain
at Court, to have its own cage, with liberty to go
out twice every day and once at night. Twelve servants
were appointed when the Nightingale went out, each
of whom had a silken string fastened to the bird’s leg,
and which they held very tight. There was really no
pleasure in an excursion of that kind. The whole City
spoke of the wonderful bird, and when two people met,
one said nothing but <em>Nightin</em>, and the other said <em>gale</em>;
and then they sighed, and understood one another.
Eleven pedlar’s children were named after the bird, but
not one of them could sing a note.</p>

<p class='c002'>One day the Emperor received a large parcel, on which
was written “The Nightingale.” “There we have a new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>book about this celebrated bird,” said the Emperor. But
it was not a book, but a little work of art, contained in a
box; an artificial nightingale, which was to be like a
natural one, but was brilliantly ornamented with diamonds,
rubies, and sapphires. So soon as the artificial
bird was wound up, he could sing one of the pieces that
he really sang, and then his tail moved up and down,
and shone with silver and gold. Round his neck hung
a little ribbon, and on that was written, <em>The Emperor
of Japan’s nightingale is poor, compared to that of the
Emperor of China.</em> “That is capital!” said they all, and
he who had brought the artificial bird, immediately received
the title, Imperial Head-Nightingale-Bringer.
“Now they must sing together; what a duet that will
be!” And so they had to sing together; but it did not go
very well, for the real Nightingale sang in its own way,
and the artificial bird sang waltzes. “That’s not his fault,”
said the Playmaster, “he’s quite perfect, and very much
in my style.” Now the artificial bird was to sing alone.
He had just as much success as the real one, and then it
was much handsomer to look at; it shone like bracelets
and breastpins. Three-and-thirty times over did it sing
the same piece, and yet it was not tired. The people
would gladly have heard it again, but the Emperor said
that the living Nightingale ought to sing something
now. But where was it? No one had noticed that it had
flown away out of the open window, back to the green
wood.</p>

<p class='c002'>“But what is that!” said the Emperor. And all the
courtiers abused the Nightingale, and declared that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>was a very ungrateful creature. “We have the best bird
after all,” said they, and so the artificial bird had to sing
again, and that was the thirty-fourth time that they
listened to the same piece. For all that they did not
know it quite by heart, for it was so very difficult, and
the Playmaster praised the bird particularly; yes, he
declared that it was better than a Nightingale, not only
with regard to its plumage, and the many beautiful diamonds,
but inside as well. “For you see, ladies and gentlemen,
and above all, your Imperial Majesty, with a
real Nightingale one can never calculate what is coming,
but in this artificial bird every thing is settled. One
can explain it; one can open it and make people understand
where the waltzes come from, how they go, and
how one follows upon another.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_011.jpg' alt='Image of Court' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c002'>“Those are quite our own ideas,” they all said, and the
speaker received permission to show the bird to the
people on the next Sunday. The people were to hear it
sing too, the Emperor commanded, and they did hear
it, and were as much pleased as if they had all got tipsy
upon tea, for that’s quite the Chinese fashion; and they
all said “Oh!” and held up their forefingers and nodded.
But the poor Fisherman, who had heard the real
Nightingale, said, “It sounds pretty enough and the
melodies resemble each other, but there’s something
wanting, and I know not what!” The real Nightingale
was banished from the country and Empire. The
artificial bird had its place on a silken cushion, close to
the Emperor’s bed; all the presents it had received, gold
and precious stones, were ranged about; in title it had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>advanced to be the High Imperial After-Dinner-Singer,
and in rank to number one on the left hand; for the
Emperor considered that side the most important on
which the heart is placed, and even in an Emperor the
heart is on the left side; and the Playmaster wrote a
work of five-and-twenty volumes about the artificial
bird; it was very learned and very long, full of the most
difficult Chinese words; but yet all the people declared
that they had read it, and understood it, for fear of being
considered stupid, and having their bodies trampled
on. So a whole year went by. The Emperor, the Court,
and all the other Chinese knew every little twitter in
the artificial bird’s song, by heart. But just for that reason
it pleased them best; they could sing it with themselves,
and they did so. The street-boys sang “Tsi-tsi-tsi-glug-glug,”
and the Emperor himself sung it too.
Yes, that was certainly famous!</p>

<p class='c002'>But one evening, when the artificial bird was singing
its best, and when the Emperor lay in bed listening to it,
something inside the bird said “Whiz!” Something
cracked. “Whirr!” All the wheels ran around, and
then the music stopped. The Emperor immediately
sprang out of bed, and caused his Body Physician to be
called; but what could he do? Then they sent for a
Watchmaker, and after a good deal of talking and investigation,
the bird was put into something like order;
but the Watchmaker said that the bird must be carefully
treated, for the barrels were worn, and it would be
impossible to put new ones in, in such a manner that
the music would go. There was a great lamentation;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>only once in a year was it permitted to let the bird sing,
and that was almost too much. But then the Playmaster
made a little speech, full of heavy words, and said
this was just as good as before, and so of course it was
as good as before.</p>

<p class='c002'>Now five years had gone by, and a real grief
came upon the whole Nation. The Chinese
really were fond of their Emperor, and now
he was ill, and could not, it was said, live
much longer. Already a new Emperor had been chosen,
and the people stood out in the street and asked the
Cavalier how their old Emperor did. P! said he, and
shook his head.</p>

<p class='c002'>Cold and pale lay the Emperor in his great gorgeous
bed; the whole Court thought him dead, and each one
ran to pay homage to the new ruler. The Chamberlains
ran out to talk it over, and the Ladies’ Maids had a great
coffee-party. All about, in all the halls and passages,
cloth had been laid down, so that no footstep could be
heard, and therefore it was quiet there, quite quiet. But
the Emperor was not dead yet; stiff and pale he lay on
the gorgeous bed with the long velvet curtains and the
heavy gold tassels; high up, a window stood open, and
the moon shone in upon the Emperor and the artificial
bird.</p>

<p class='c002'>The poor Emperor could scarcely breathe; it was just
as if something lay upon his chest; he opened his eyes,
and then he saw that it was Death, who sat upon his
chest, and had put on his golden crown, and held in one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>hand the Emperor’s sword and in the other his beautiful
banner. And all around, from among the folds of the
splendid velvet curtains, strange heads peered forth; a
few very ugly, the rest quite lovely and mild. These
were all the Emperor’s bad and good deeds, that stood
before him now that Death sat upon his heart. “Do you
remember this?” whispered one to the other. “Do you
remember that?” and then they told him so much that
the perspiration ran from his forehead. “I did not know
that!” said the Emperor. “Music! music! the great Chinese
drum!” he cried, “so that I need not hear all they
say!” and they continued speaking, and Death nodded
like a Chinaman to all they said. “Music! music!” cried
the Emperor. “You little precious golden bird, sing,
sing! I have given you gold and costly presents; I have
even hung my golden slipper around your neck; sing,
now, sing!” But the bird stood still; no one was there to
wind him up, and he could not sing without that; but
Death continued to stare at the Emperor with his great
hollow eyes, and it was quiet, fearfully quiet!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_014.jpg' alt='Image of house' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c002'>Then there sounded from the window, suddenly, the
most lovely song. It was the little live Nightingale, that
sat outside on a spray. It had heard of the Emperor’s sad
plight and had come to sing to him of comfort and
hope. And as it sung the spectres grew paler and paler;
the blood ran quicker and more quickly through the
Emperor’s weak limbs, and even Death listened, and
said, “Go on, little Nightingale, go on!” “But will
you give me that splendid golden sword? Will you give
me that rich banner? Will you give me the Emperor’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>crown?” And Death gave up each of these treasures for a
song. And the Nightingale sang on and on; and it sung
of the quiet Churchyard where the white roses grow,
where the elder-blossom smells sweet, and where the
fresh grass is moistened by the tears of survivors. Then
Death felt a longing to see his Garden, and floated out
at the window in the form of a cold white mist.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thanks, thanks!” said the Emperor. “You heavenly
little bird! I know you well! I banished you from my
Country and Empire, and yet you have charmed away
the evil faces from my couch, and banished Death from
my heart! How can I reward you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You have rewarded me,” replied the Nightingale. “I
have drawn tears from your eyes, when I sang the first
time; I shall never forget that. These are the jewels that
rejoice a singer’s heart; but now sleep and grow fresh
and strong again; I will sing you something.” And it
sang, and the Emperor fell into a sweet slumber. Ah!
how mild and refreshing that sleep was. The sun shone
upon him through the windows, when he awoke refreshed
and restored; not one of his servants had yet returned,
for they all thought he was dead; only the
Nightingale still sat beside him and sang.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You must always stay with me,” said the Emperor.
“You shall sing as you please; and I’ll break the artificial
bird into a thousand pieces.” “Not so,” replied
the Nightingale. “It did well so long as it could; keep
it as you have done till now. I cannot build my nest in
the Palace to dwell in it, but let me come when I feel
the wish; then I will sit in the evening on the spray
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>yonder by the window, and sing you something so that
you may be glad and thoughtful at once. And I will sing
of those who are happy, and of those who suffer. I will
sing of good and of evil that remains hidden round about
you. The little singing-bird flies far around, to the poor
Fisherman, to the Peasant’s roof, to every one who
dwells far away from you and from your Court. I love
your heart more than your crown, and yet the crown
has an air of sanctity about it; I come, I shall sing to
you; but one thing you must promise me.” “Every
thing!” said the Emperor; and he stood there in his imperial
robes, which he had put on himself, and pressed
the sword which was heavy with gold to his heart.</p>

<p class='c002'>“One thing I beg of you; tell no one that you have a
little bird that tells you everything. Then it will go all
the better.” And the Nightingale flew away. The servants
came in to look to their dead Emperor—and—yes,
there they stood, and the Emperor said, “Good-morning.”</p>

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
